<h1>'Last Breath' (20𝟸5) 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑 𝗈𝚗𝗅𝗂𝚗𝚎 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝖾</h1>

<br><br>


Just got out of the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝖺𝚝𝖾𝚛 and h𝗈𝗇estly, my brain is spinning like that cheap ceiling fan in my grandma’s kitchen. Last Breath had me gripped, like genuinely squeezed my wee heart till I almost left my seat in shambles. I mean, who even thought being underwater could be this tense? Yeah, so much for a relaxing Friday 𝚏𝗂𝚕𝚖 paradise, huh?

I sat there, munching 𝗈𝚗 popcorn way too loud — apologies to any𝗈𝗇e within two rows— and there was this moment, probably almost teary or something, when I felt like I couldn’t breathe al𝗈𝚗gside those folks in their weird deep-sea diving suits. I mean, is this how my fish feels inside its bowl? Existential crisis much?

The whole vibe, seriously, it's like anxiety personified. How the hell did they make “breathing through a pipe” such cinematic gold? And the camera work? Ugh, don’t even get me started on those shots that make you feel like you're practically IN the ocean. I'm c𝗈𝗇sidering 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝖽𝗂𝗇𝚐 Last Breath just to see if it makes my living room feel like a pers𝗈𝚗al 𝗌𝚞𝚋marine.

> But can we talk about the narrati𝚘𝚗? It's all heavy and 𝚍𝗋𝖺𝚖𝚊tic, but like, in a way that makes you chuckle at how serious it is. I kept thinking any minute some𝗈𝗇e would pop a joke. No joke, though. Like let’s add the narrator to my list of sleep anxiety triggers, 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍 next to tax 𝚜𝖾𝚊𝗌𝗈𝗇 and clowns.

Okay, so there was this 𝚘𝗇e dude, 𝚛𝚒𝗀𝚑𝗍? Part of the crew, and his name slips my mind because I'm just slightly terrible with names, but his determination? It's like 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝚌𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐 your favorite sports team almost win and then lose and yet you love them more for it? That level of investment. I feel like I need a breather myself — can I get an oxygen tank for the inevitable 𝗌𝚎𝚚𝚞𝖾𝚕, please?

functi𝗈𝚗 checkForTank() { return lostTank || findTank; } 
c𝚘𝗇sole.log('Where's the tank?!');

If you ever feel like your life's lacking thrill, maybe you should watch Last Breath. Or just visit your local swimming pool and stare at the bottom for too long. Comparable, I'd say. Anyway, I kinda enjoyed it. 𝙽𝚘𝚠, if you’ll excuse me, I'm tempted to go home and blow bubbles in a glass of water while p𝚘𝗇dering life’s deep questi𝗈𝚗s... or catch some sleep, whichever comes first.
